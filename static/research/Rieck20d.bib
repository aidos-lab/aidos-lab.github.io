	abstract = {In this work, we present concepts for the analysis of the evolution of two-dimensional skeletons. By introducing novel persistence concepts, we are able to reduce typical temporal incoherence, and provide insight in skeleton dynamics. We exemplify our approach by means of a simulation of viscous fingering---a highly dynamic process whose analysis is a hot topic in porous media research.},
