# Research

The AIDOS lab is dedicated to establishing foundational principles in machine learning. Leveraging our experience in computational geometry and topology, we focus on shaping well-principled methods to address holes in rapidly evolving AI landscape. We see ourselves as toolsmiths, crafting both observational and interventional frameworks using concepts such as the Euler characteristic, metric space magnitude, curvature, persistent homology, etc. Whether working with graphs, images, or natural language, our goal is to build tools that tackle the most difficult questions, prioritizing simplicity, elegance, and interpretability over mere performance. We hope our work can give back to the community, empowering new research directions and application developments grounded in principled methods.
