          SCOTT is a Python package for computing **curvature filtrations** for graphs and graph distributions. Our method introduces a novel way to compare graph distributions by combining discrete curvature on graphs with persistent homology, providing descriptors of graph sets that are: *robust*, *stable*, *expressive*, and *compatible with statistical testing*.
