description = """\
The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) has proven to be a powerful representation, 
combining geometrical and topological characteristics of shapes and graphs.
With the Differentiable Euler Characteristic Transform (DECT), we provide a fast 
and computationally efficient implementation of a differentiable, end-to-end-trainable ECT, 
which can be integrated into deep neural networks.
