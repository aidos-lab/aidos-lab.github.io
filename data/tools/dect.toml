description = """\
The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) has proven to be a powerful representation, 
combining geometrical and topological characteristics of shapes and graphs.
We provide a fast and **computationally efficient** implementation of a **differentiable, 
end-to-end-trainable Euler Characteristic Transform**, which can be integrated into deep neural networks.
