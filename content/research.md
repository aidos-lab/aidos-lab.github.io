# Research

The AIDOS lab is dedicated to establishing foundational principles in
machine learning. Leveraging our experience in _computational geometry_
and _topology_, we focus on shaping well-principled methods to address
holes in rapidly evolving AI landscape. We see ourselves as
[_toolsmiths_](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/2022/toolsmith/),
crafting both observational and interventional frameworks
using concepts such as the Euler characteristic, metric space magnitude,
curvature, persistent homology, etc. Whether working with graphs,
images, or natural language, our goal is to build tools that shed light
on the most difficult questions, prioritizing simplicity, elegance, and
interpretability over mere performance. We hope our work can give back
to the community, empowering new research directions and application
developments grounded in principled methods. Although our core research
targets method development in machine learning, we are also passionate
about impacting change with the help of our wonderful collaborators in
biomedical, healthcare, and environmental applications.
