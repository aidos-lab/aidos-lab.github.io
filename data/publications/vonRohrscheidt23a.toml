summary = """\
The manifold hypothesis is often assumed in data analysis. But what
happens if it does not hold? In this publication, we are analysing to
what extent a data set deviates from being a manifold. We develop
**Euclidicity**, a new multi-scale score based on persistent local
homology, to assess this deviation.
