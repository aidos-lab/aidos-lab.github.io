# Join us

Thanks for your interest in our group! Why not consider joining the
team? We are seeking students&nbsp;(at all levels) with strong
quantitative backgrounds&nbsp;(computer science, mathematics, physics,
...). You should be interested in working at the intersection of
different fields and feel comfortable about writing code.

Since the group is still starting to establish itself, you have the
unique opportunity to truly shape and influence things here.

While there is a lot of value in such endeavours, most of our projects
are not leader-board science in that they do not have the explicit
goal of beating all state-of-the-art methods. That is *not* to say that
we are not interested in producing relevant methods or that leader-board
science is bad, on the contrary: As [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin)
outlines when describing his ideal intellectual [ecosystem](https://github.com/lintool/guide/blob/master/ecosystem.md),
this type of research is just what comes more naturally to him and his
group. Our goals are different in that we want to produce excellent
science based on methods whose performance we can *explain* and
*understand*. This necessitates comprehensive comparisons with other
methods, ablation studies, and many additional tricks to figure out what
is going on. If this sounds enticing to you, we would love to hear from
you!

To learn more about our working style, see [this note for potential
student collaborators](https://bastian.rieck.me/collaborations) and read
our [research guide](/guide).

## Bachelor's and master's theses

If you are interested in writing your thesis with us, please send
your CV, your transcript of records, and a brief cover letter stating
your research interests to bastian@rieck.me. Your
cover letter should provide answers to the following questions:

1. Are there any research papers of the group that pique your interest
   specifically? (You do not have to be an expert in the topic yet, of
   course!)

2. Are you more comfortable working *empirically*, i.e. lots of
   implementations, experiments, and so on, or working *theoretically*,
   i.e. lots of proofs, derivations, and more?

3. When would you be available for working on the thesis?

## Ph.D. positions

If you are interested in working with us, please reach out to
bastian@rieck.me with (a) a brief motivation letter, (b) your CV, and
(c) a full transcript of your grades. We value interdisciplinary,
non-standard backgrounds and attention to detail.

## Research visits

If you are interested in a short-term research opportunity, such as
a research visit over the summer, please reach out to bastian@rieck.me
with (a) a brief motivation letter in which you describe the purpose of
the stay, (b) your CV, and (c) a suggestion for funding opportunities.
We are particularly interested in stays that may result in long-term
collaborations.
