summary = """\ 
In response to rising interest for generative model use in drug development,
we introduce a new topological and geometric descriptor
for graph distributions based on curvature filtrations. As well as favorable 
stability and expressivity properties, our method affords
scalable statistical comparisons and hypothesis testing for sets of graphs, providing
an exciting and well-principled method for evaluating Graph Generative Models.
