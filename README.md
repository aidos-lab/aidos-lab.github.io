# AIDOS LAB

This is the repository of the [AIDOS LAB](https://aidos.group). I collect
some generic usage notes in this file.

## Fonts

- The font used on the website and in the logo is 'Fira Sans' in the
  'Light' variant. The 'Light' variant is used nowhere else on the
  website.
- The Helmholtz.AI font face is called 'Herrmann'
- The AIH font and Helmholtz Centre font is called 'Info Text Web Pro.'

The first font is free to use; the others can be acquired from the
respective websites.
