Mathieu seeks to extend machine learning to topological and
combinatorial domains, including manifolds, graphs, and simplicial
complexes. This exciting adventure inspires him to explore tools in
disciplines as diverse as differential geometry, algebraic topology,
quantum mechanics, differential equations, and signal processing.
Currently, his research focuses on developing Gaussian processes that
leverage the richness of non-Euclidean data.
