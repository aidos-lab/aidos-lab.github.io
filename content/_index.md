# Welcome

Welcome to the website of the aidos lab at [Helmholtz.AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai). We are interested
in discovering hidden structures in complex data sets, with a special
focus on tackling challenges arising in healthcare applications.

# About

'aidos' has two meanings that complement each other well. The first
meaning originates from the Greek word 'αἰδώς,' which means 'awe' or
'reverence.' This is indicative of the awe that we feel when we work
on challenging problems in healthcare research, aiming to improve this
world using machine learning. The second meaning refers to our mission
statement, viz. to develop **a**rtificial **i**ntelligence for
**d**iscovering **o**ccult **s**tructures.
