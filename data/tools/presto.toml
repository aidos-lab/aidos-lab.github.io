description     = """\
            The world of machine learning research is riddled with small decisions, from data collection, cleaning, into model selection and parameter tuning ðŸŽ¶. Each choice leads to a potential universe where we can analyze and interpret results. PRESTO offers topological tools to efficiently measure the structural variation between representations that arise from different choices in a machine learning workflow.
