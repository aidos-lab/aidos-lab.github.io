description = """\
The manifold hypothesis, which assumes that data lies on or close to an unknown manifold of 
low intrinsic dimension, is a staple of modern machine learning research. However, recent 
work has shown that real-world data exhibits distinct non-manifold structures, i.e. singularities, 
that can lead to erroneous findings. We address this issue by developing a topological framework that 
(i) quantifies the local intrinsic dimension, and (ii) yields a Euclidicity score for assessing the 
'manifoldness' of a point along multiple scales.
