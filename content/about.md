# About

'AIDOS' has two meanings that complement each other well.  The first
meaning refers to our mission statement, viz. to develop **A**rtificial
**I**ntelligence for **D**iscovering **O**bscured **S**hapes.  The
second meaning originates from the Greek word 'αἰδώς,' which means
'awe,' 'reverence,' or 'humility.' This awe or humility should serve as
one of our guiding principles when we work on challenging problems in
healthcare research, aiming to improve our world using machine
learning.
