          Rubén is interested in developing the foundations of 
          topological and categorical deep learning models. On the 
          topological side, Rubén enjoys working with models that
          leverage the topological and combinatorial structures 
          of the input. On the categorical side, Rubén is especially
          interested in studying the fundamental blocks
          of deep learning by means of category theory and in
          developing logic and symbolic neural networks backed by
          categorical methods.
