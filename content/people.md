# People

We, the people of the AIDOS Lab, firmly believe in and are committed to [Dr. Federico Ardila-Mantilla's axioms](https://fardila.com/):

- **Axiom 1.** Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
- **Axiom 2.** Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
- **Axiom 3.** Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
- **Axiom 4.** Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

All people are listed in chronological order of joining the lab or
