	abstract = {Abstract. Diffusion condensation is a dynamic process
that yields a sequence of multiscale data
representations that aim to encode meaningful
abstractions. It has proven effective for manifold
learning, denoising, clustering, and visualization of
high-dimensional data. Diffusion condensation is
constructed as a time-inhomogeneous process where
each step first computes a diffusion operator and
then applies it to the data. We theoretically analyze
the convergence and evolution of this process from
geometric, spectral, and topological perspectives.
From a geometric perspective, we obtain convergence
bounds based on the smallest transition probability
and the radius of the data, whereas from a spectral
perspective, our bounds are based on the
eigenspectrum of the diffusion kernel. Our spectral
results are of particular interest since most of the
literature on data diffusion is focused on
homogeneous processes. From a topological
perspective, we show that diffusion condensation
generalizes centroid-based hierarchical clustering.
We use this perspective to obtain a bound based on
the number of data points, independent of their
location. To understand the evolution of the data
geometry beyond convergence, we use topological data
analysis. We show that the condensation process
itself defines an intrinsic condensation homology. We
use this intrinsic topology, as well as the ambient
persistent homology, of the condensation process to
study how the data changes over diffusion time. We
demonstrate both types of topological information in
well-understood toy examples. Our work gives
theoretical insight into the convergence of diffusion
condensation and shows that it provides a link
between topological and geometric data analysis.},
