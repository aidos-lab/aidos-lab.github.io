	abstract = {We develop a novel hierarchy for zero-dimensional persistence pairs, i.e., connected components, which is capable of capturing more fine-grained spatial relations between persistence pairs. Our work is motivated by a lack of spatial relationships between features in persistence diagrams, leading to a limited expressive power. We build upon a recently-introduced hierarchy of pairs in persistence diagrams that augments the pairing stored in persistence diagrams with information about which components merge. Our proposed hierarchy captures differences in branching structure. Moreover, we show how to use our hierarchy to measure the spatial stability of a pairing and we define a rank function for persistence pairs and demonstrate different applications.},
