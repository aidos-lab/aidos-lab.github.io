description = """\
The **magnitude of a metric space** is a powerful invariant that provides a measure of the *effective size* 
of a space across multiple scales, while also capturing numerous geometrical properties, 
such as curvature, density, entropy or diversity. We provide a toolbox for computing and comparing
the magnitude of metric spaces.
