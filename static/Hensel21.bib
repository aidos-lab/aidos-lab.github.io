@article{Hensel21,
	abstract = {The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of
computational topology: methods and concepts from
algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined
to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated
their utility in numerous areas such as computational
biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data
analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain
comprising topology-based techniques is often referred
to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their
applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods
have also proven to be effective in supporting,
enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine
learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we
review the state of the art of a nascent field we
refer to as “topological machine learning,” i.e., the
successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and
machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural
networks. We identify common threads, current
applications, and future challenges.},
