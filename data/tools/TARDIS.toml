description = """\
The manifold hypothesis is a staple of modern machine learning research. However, real-world data exhibits 
distinct **non-manifold structures, i.e. singularities**, that can lead to erroneous findings. 
We provide a topological framework that quantifies the local intrinsic dimension, and yields a 
**Euclidicity score** for assessing the 'manifoldness' of a point along multiple scales.
