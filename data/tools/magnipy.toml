description = """\
The magnitude of a metric space is a powerful invariant that provides a measure of the 'effective size' 
of a space across multiple scales, while also capturing numerous geometrical properties, 
such as curvature, density, or entropy. We provide a toolbox for computing and comparing
the magnitude of metric spaces.
