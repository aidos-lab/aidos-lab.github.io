# Find Us

We are located at the PÃ©rolles Campus of the University of Fribourg. Here is a map&nbsp;(click for larger version):

We are located in the highlighted building, i.e. building PER 21. The campus can be reached by walking from the main station or by taking buses 1, 3, 8, 9, or 10 and exiting at Fribourg, Charmettes." >}}

# Join Us

Thanks for your interest in our group! Why not consider joining the
team? We are seeking students&nbsp;(at all levels) with strong
quantitative backgrounds&nbsp;(computer science, mathematics, physics,
...). You should be interested in working at the intersection of
different fields and feel comfortable about writing code.

Since the group is still starting to establish itself, you have the
unique opportunity to truly shape and influence things here.

While there is a lot of value in such endeavours, most of our projects
are not leader-board science in that they do not have the explicit
goal of beating all state-of-the-art methods. That is *not* to say that
we are not interested in producing relevant methods or that leader-board
science is bad, on the contrary: As [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin)
outlines when describing his ideal intellectual [ecosystem](https://github.com/lintool/guide/blob/master/ecosystem.md),
this type of research is just what comes more naturally to him and his
group. Our goals are different in that we want to produce excellent
science based on methods whose performance we can *explain* and
*understand*. This necessitates comprehensive comparisons with other
methods, ablation studies, and many additional tricks to figure out what
is going on. If this sounds enticing to you, we would love to hear from
you!

student collaborators](https://bastian.rieck.me/collaborations) and read

## Bachelor's and Master's Theses

If you are interested in writing your thesis with us, please send
your CV, your transcript of records, and a brief cover letter stating
your research interests to bastian.grossenbacher@unifr.ch. Your
cover letter should provide answers to the following questions:

1. Are there any research papers of the group that pique your interest
   specifically (You do not have to be an expert in the topic yet, of
   course!) or do you already have a topic in mind?

2. Are you more comfortable working *empirically*, i.e. lots of
   implementations, experiments, and so on, or working *theoretically*,
   i.e. lots of proofs, derivations, and more?

3. When would you be available for working on the thesis?

Some **formalities**:

- You should be *familiar* with machine learning and *comfortable* with the Python programming language.
- Your thesis has to be written using the [LaTeX typesetting system](https://www.latex-project.org). Any template will do, there are no strict requirements.
- Your thesis can be written either in English, German, or French. We recommend writing the thesis in English as an additional training to interact with contemporary research.
- You have to disclose the use of AI tools.

## Ph.D. Positions

If you are interested in working with us, please reach out to
bastian.grossenbacher@unifr.ch with (a) a brief motivation letter, (b) your CV, and
(c) a full transcript of your grades. We value interdisciplinary,
non-standard backgrounds and attention to detail.

## Research Visits

If you are interested in a short-term research opportunity, such as
a research visit over the summer, please reach out to
bastian.grossenbacher@unifr.ch
with (a) a brief motivation letter in which you describe the purpose of
the stay, (b) your CV, and (c) a suggestion for funding opportunities.
We are particularly interested in stays that may result in long-term
collaborations.
