description     = """\
          SCOTT is a Python package for **computing curvature filtrations** for graphs and graph distributions. Our method introduces a novel way to compare graph distributions, avoiding the limitations of Maximal Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which has known [drawbacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01098).<br><br>By combining discrete curvature on graphs with persistent homology, SCOTT provides expressive descriptors of graph sets that are: *robust*, *stable*, *expressive*, and *compatible with statistical testing*.<br><br>The package is highly adaptable, offering several options for **user customization**, including different curvature computation methods and diverse metrics for comparing persistent homology outputs.
