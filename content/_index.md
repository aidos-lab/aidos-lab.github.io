# Welcome

Welcome to the website of the AIDOS LAB at the [Institute of AI for
Health](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/aih), an institute of the
[Helmholtz Zentrum München](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de)! We are fascinated by
discovering hidden structures in complex data sets, in particular those
arising in healthcare applications.

Our primary research interests are situated at the intersection of
**geometrical deep learning**, **topological machine learning**, and
**representation learning**. We want to make use of geometrical and
topological information---also known as **manifold learning**---to imbue
neural networks with more information in their respective tasks, leading
to better and more robust outcomes.

Following the dictum 'theory without practice is empty,' we also
develop methods to address challenges in biomedicine or healthcare
applications. Of particular interest are the analysis of [MRI data sets
to improve our understanding of human cognition and neurodegenerative
disorders](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/4d771504ddcd28037b4199740df767e6-Abstract.html),
as well as the analysis of multivariate clinical time series to detect and prevent the [onset of sepsis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05230) or myocardial ischemia.

# About

'AIDOS' has two meanings that complement each other well.  The first
meaning refers to our mission statement, viz. to develop **A**rtificial
**I**ntelligence for **D**iscovering **O**bscured **S**hapes.  The
second meaning originates from the Greek word 'αἰδώς,' which means
'awe,' 'reverence,' or 'humility.' This awe or humility should serve as
one of our guiding principles when we work on challenging problems in
healthcare research, aiming to improve our world using machine
learning.

# Join us

Thanks for your interest in our group! Why not consider joining the
team? We are seeking students&nbsp;(at all levels) with strong
quantitative backgrounds&nbsp;(computer science, mathematics, physics,
...). You should be interested in working at the intersection of
different fields and feel comfortable about writing code.

Since the group is still starting to establish itself, you have the
unique opportunity to truly shape and influence things here.

We are not interested in 'leader-board science' or 'chasing the
state-of-the-art' in a table. That is *not* to say that we are not
interested in producing relevant methods! Our overarching goal is to
produce excellent science using methods whose performance we can
*explain* and *understand*. This necessitates comprehensive comparisons
with other methods, ablation studies, and many additional tricks to
figure out what is going on. If this sounds enticing to you, we would
love to hear from you!

## Bachelor's and master's theses

If you are interested in writing your thesis with us, please send
your CV, your transcript of records, and a brief cover letter stating
your research interests to bastian.rieck@helmholtz-muenchen.de.

## Ph.D. positions

If you are interested in working with us and have a background in
mathematics, computer science, physics, or a general penchant for
computational methods, please send your CV to
bastian.rieck@helmholtz-muenchen.de for general inquiries on Ph.D.
positions.
