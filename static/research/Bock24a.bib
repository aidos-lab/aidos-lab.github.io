	abstract = {Functionally relevant coronary artery disease (fCAD)
can result in premature death or nonfatal acute
myocardial infarction. Its early detection is
a fundamentally important task in medicine. Classical
detection approaches suffer from limited diagnostic
accuracy or expose patients to possibly harmful
radiation. Here we show how machine learning (ML) can
outperform cardiologists in predicting the presence
of stress-induced fCAD in terms of area under the
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC: 0.71 vs.
0.64, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}4.0E-13). We present
two ML approaches, the first using eight static
clinical variables, whereas the second leverages
electrocardiogram signals from exercise stress
testing. At a target post-test probability for fCAD
of <15{\%}, ML facilitates a potential reduction of
imaging procedures by 15--17{\%} compared to the
cardiologist's judgement. Predictive performance is
validated on an internal temporal data split as well
as externally. We also show that combining clinical
judgement with conventional ML and deep learning
using logistic regression results in a mean AUROC of
0.74.},
