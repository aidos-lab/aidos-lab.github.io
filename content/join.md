# Join us

Thanks for your interest in our group! Why not consider joining the
team? We are seeking students&nbsp;(at all levels) with strong
quantitative backgrounds&nbsp;(computer science, mathematics, physics,
...). You should be interested in working at the intersection of
different fields and feel comfortable about writing code.

Since the group is still starting to establish itself, you have the
unique opportunity to truly shape and influence things here.

We are not interested in 'leader-board science' or 'chasing the
state-of-the-art' in a table. That is *not* to say that we are not
interested in producing relevant methods! Our overarching goal is to
produce excellent science using methods whose performance we can
*explain* and *understand*. This necessitates comprehensive comparisons
with other methods, ablation studies, and many additional tricks to
figure out what is going on. If this sounds enticing to you, we would
love to hear from you!

To learn more about our working style, see [this note for potential
student collaborators](https://bastian.rieck.me/collaborations).

## Bachelor's and master's theses

If you are interested in writing your thesis with us, please send
your CV, your transcript of records, and a brief cover letter stating
your research interests to bastian.rieck@helmholtz-muenchen.de. Your
cover letter should provide answers to the following questions:

1. Are there any research papers of the group that pique your interest
   specifically? (You do not have to be an expert in the topic yet, of
   course!)

2. Are you more comfortable working *empirically*, i.e. lots of
   implementations, experiments, and so on, or working *theoretically*,
   i.e. lots of proofs, derivations, and more?

3. When would you be available for working on the thesis?

## Ph.D. positions

If you are interested in working with us and have a background in
mathematics, computer science, physics, or a general penchant for
computational methods, please send your CV to
bastian.rieck@helmholtz-muenchen.de for general inquiries on Ph.D.
positions.

## Research visits

If you are interested in a short-term research opportunity, such as
a research visit over the summer, please reach out
bastian.rieck@helmholtz-muenchen.de. We are particularly interested in
stays that may result in long-term collaborations.

**If you are looking for an internship, note that our institution
does not permit paid internships.** There are funding opportunities for
such internships available; check out [RISE](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-germany/find-an-internship/)
or [DAAD Scholarships](https://www.daad.de/en/study-and-research-in-germany/scholarships/) in general.
