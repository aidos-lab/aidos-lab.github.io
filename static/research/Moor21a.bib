	abstract = {Background: Sepsis is among the leading causes of
death in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide and its
recognition, particularly in the early stages of the
disease, remains a medical challenge. The advent of an
affluence of available digital health data has created
a setting in which machine learning can be used for
digital biomarker discovery, with the ultimate goal to
advance the early recognition of sepsis.Objective: To
systematically review and evaluate studies employing
machine learning for the prediction of sepsis in the
ICU.Data Sources: Using Embase, Google Scholar,
PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science, we
systematically searched the existing literature for
machine learning-driven sepsis onset prediction for
patients in the ICU.Study Eligibility Criteria: All
peer-reviewed articles using machine learning for the
prediction of sepsis onset in adult ICU patients were
included. Studies focusing on patient populations
outside the ICU were excluded.Study Appraisal and
Synthesis Methods: A systematic review was performed
according to the PRISMA guidelines. Moreover,
a quality assessment of all eligible studies was
performed.Results: Out of 974 identified articles, 22
and 21 met the criteria to be included in the
systematic review and quality assessment,
respectively.  A multitude of machine learning
algorithms were applied to refine the early prediction
of sepsis. The quality of the studies ranged from
“poor” (satisfying ≤ 40\% of the quality criteria) to
“very good” (satisfying ≥ 90\% of the quality
criteria). The majority of the studies (n = 19,
86.4\%) employed an offline training scenario combined
with a horizon evaluation, while two studies
implemented an online scenario (n = 2, 9.1\%). The
massive inter-study heterogeneity in terms of model
development, sepsis definition, prediction time
windows, and outcomes precluded a meta-analysis. Last,
only two studies provided publicly accessible source
code and data sources fostering
reproducibility.Limitations: Articles were only
eligible for inclusion when employing machine learning
algorithms for the prediction of sepsis onset in the
ICU. This restriction led to the exclusion of studies
focusing on the prediction of septic shock,
sepsis-related mortality, and patient populations
outside the ICU.Conclusions and Key Findings:
A growing number of studies employs machine learning
to optimize the early prediction of sepsis through
digital biomarker discovery. This review, however,
highlights several shortcomings of the current
approaches, including low comparability and
reproducibility. Finally, we gather recommendations
how these challenges can be addressed before deploying
these models in prospective analyses.Systematic Review
