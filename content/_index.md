# Welcome

Welcome to the website of the AIDOS LAB at the [University of
Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch)
We are fascinated by
discovering hidden structures in complex data sets, in particular those
arising in healthcare applications.

Our primary research interests are situated at the intersection of
**geometry, topology, and machine learning**.
We want to make use of geometrical and
topological information to imbue
neural networks with more information in their respective tasks, leading
to better and more robust outcomes.
Along the way, we develop new **manifold learning** techniques, new
**representation learning** algorithms, and much more.

Following the dictum 'theory without practice is empty,' we
address challenges in biomedicine and healthcare
applications.
