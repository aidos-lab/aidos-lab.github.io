description = """\
Bridging geometry and topology, curvature is a powerful and expressive
invariant. While the utility of curvature has been theoretically and
empirically confirmed in the context of manifolds and graphs, its
generalisation to the emerging domain of hypergraphs has remained
largely unexplored. Our toolbox aims to fill this gap and presents a new
framework for hypergraph curvature.
