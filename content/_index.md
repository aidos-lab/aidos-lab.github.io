# Welcome

Welcome to the website of the AIDOS Lab at the [University of
Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch).
We are fascinated by
discovering hidden structures in complex data sets, in particular those
arising in healthcare and environmental applications.

Our primary research interests are situated at the intersection of
**geometry, topology, and machine learning**. From data-centric evaluation frameworks to novel architecture developments, we make use of geometrical and
topological information to imbue our methods with foundations that foster interpretability and robustness. Along the way, we develop new **manifold learning** techniques, new
**representation learning** algorithms, and much more.

Following the dictum 'theory without practice is empty,' we
address challenges in biomedicine and healthcare
applications. Check out our [research page]({{< relref "/research" >}}) to learn more about our current projects.

If you are student at the [University of Fribourg](https://unifr.ch) and
are interested in writing a bachelor's or master's thesis with us,
please [get in touch](https://aidos.group/contact/#bachelors-and-masters-theses).

## Mission Statement

'AIDOS' has two meanings that complement each other well. The first
meaning refers to our mission statement, viz. to develop **A**rtificial
**I**ntelligence for **D**ata-**O**riented **S**cience. The second
meaning originates from the Greek word 'αἰδώς,' which means 'awe,'
'reverence,' or 'humility.' This awe or humility should serve as one of
our guiding principles when we work on challenging problems, aiming to
improve the world using machine learning.
