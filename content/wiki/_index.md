    This is a collection of small guides and tutorials that might help you through your PhD life.
    Did you just go through the process of setting up a piece of software that involves many steps?
    Do you know just the right tool for a specific task? Did you finally find a solution for this problem that has been 
    bothering you for weeks? Share it here!
  
    Also, don't be discouraged to create a page about a topic
    that everybody seems to know already about. Depending on the prior knowledge, what you have to learn
    at the start of your research career greatly differs.
